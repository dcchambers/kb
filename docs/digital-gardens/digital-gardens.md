# Digital Gardens

A *digital garden* is an online place, somewhere between a blog, a wiki, and a personal notebook.
It's a place to plant thoughts and let them grow.
Some things die and that's OK.
There's no expectation for perfection in a digital garden.

## Growth Status

I assign a status to each note in this garden, inspired by [Brad Wood's digital garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/about#aboutthisgarden).

|Status|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Seed|New content planted less than a year ago|
|Sprout|Content planted over a year ago & regularly tended|
|Mature|Content planted over 2 years ago & regularly tended|
|Decaying|Content not tended in over a year|
