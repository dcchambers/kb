I believe that video game wikis can be an incredibly source of information and community when done well. Sometimes that means official wikis sponsored by the game developer/publisher. Sometimes independent ones. But all of them depend on a strong community with player-lead contributions and management.

Wiki software is incredibly powerful and a perfect match for documenting everything about a video game.

These are some of my favorites:

- [bg-wiki (Final Fantasy XI)](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Main_Page)
- [Factori Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/)
- [Fire Emblem Wiki](https://fireemblemwiki.org/)
- [Path of Exiles Wiki](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Path_of_Exile_Wiki)
- [Runescape Wiki](https://runescape.wiki/)
- [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki)
