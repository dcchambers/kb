# Interesting Software Companies

A list of software companies that I find interesting for various reasons (technical achievement, design, company culture, etc).
Being on this list does not mean I *love* the company, just that I think they are a note-worthy software company.
While there is no particular theme, these are all software companies, and many of them make product(s) that are related to my own professional work.

## Established Players

- GitHub (Owner: Microsoft) - Wonderful product and excellent clean design.
- GitLab - Love the open culture.
- Hashicorp - A technical wonder.
- Heroku (Owner: Salesforce) - Created the standard in software deployment tech and many of us are still chasing that UX.

## Rising Stars
