# Mastodon

If you use [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) and [Chrome](https://chrome.com), you should be using the [Graze for Mastodon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graze-for-mastodon/epocinhmkcnjfjobnglchpbncndobblj) extension.
It makes interacting with Mastodon accounts on other servers much better and provides a more seamless experience akin to Twitter for following and interacting with posts.

No more copying mastodon profile URLs to your own mastodon instance in order to follow and interact with someone.
