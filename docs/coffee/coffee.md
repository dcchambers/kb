## Notes

### How Big Is a Cup of Coffee?

There is no international standard for measuring a "cup" of coffee. It varies by manufacturer. For most manufacturers, a "cup" of coffee is 5 or 6 fluid ounces.

In Japan, a "cup" of coffee is 200ml (6.76oz).

### Filter Types

There are four "standard" pour-over coffee styles, based on filter type
- Wedge Filters (Melitta-Style)
  - Melitta officially calls their filters "cone filters" but I refer to them as "wedge filters" to differentiate them from V60-style filters that are truly conical.
- Conical Filters (V60-Style)
- Flat-Bottom Filters (Kalita Wave-Style)
- Chemex-style (large filters that must be folded to use)

### Golden Ratio

The coffee **golden ratio** is talked about a lot amongst enthusiasts. Funnily enough, the ratio actually varies. It's between 15-18 parts water to 1 part ground coffee (by weight).

I usually use a 1:16 ratio - so if I want to make 16oz (473ml) of coffee, I usually use 30g of coffee and 480g of water.
