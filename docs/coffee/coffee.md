## Notes

- A coffee "cup" has no standard size. By most manufacturers, a "cup" of coffee is 5 or 6 fluid ounces.
  - In Japan, a "cup" of coffee is 200ml (6.76oz).
- There are four "standard" pour-over coffee styles, based on filter type
  - Wedge Filters (Melitta-Style)
    - Melitta officially calls their filters "cone filters" but I refer to them as "wedge filters" to differentiate them from V60-style filters that are truly conical.
  - Conical Filters (V60-Style)
  - Flat-Bottom Filters (Kalita Wave-Style)
  - Chemex-style (large filters that must be folded to use)
