# How I Take Notes

## Tools I Use Regularly

- Pen and paper
  - For capturing quick notes, especially anything that requires diagramming, nothing beats a pen and paper The obvious problem is that it's difficult to search through pen and paper notes (if only we had cmd-F/ctrl-F for everyday life).
- Apple Notes app
  - I use this exclusively to quickly write a note/thought but I don't keep anything here long-term.
- Markdown files stores in Git repos
  - Especially for shared team documentation
  - Notes I want to make publicly availably (lke this digital garden!)
  - Anything where I see versioning being valuable (eg seeing how a note changes over time)
- [Notekeeper](https://github.com/dcchambers/note-keeper)
  - Another quick way to take one-off notes from the command line.
- Google Keep
  - My main way of taking notes on my phone and also sharing them with family members.

### At Work

- Confluence (Exclusively for work)

## Experimental

Tools I am experimenting with.

- Notion
- Obsidian

## Semi-Retired

I haven't fully given up on these tools yes, but they are not an active part of my note-taking regiment.

- Bullet Journal
  - I used to be an avid Bullet Journaler in my college years, but I don't find that it maps well to a professional working environment when you need to share calendar events and/or notes with colleagues.

## Retired

Things I used to use but don't any more.
